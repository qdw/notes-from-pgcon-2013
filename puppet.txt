PostgreSQL and Puppet, by Steve Singer (PGCon 2013)

Steve
    a slony maintainer
    works for Afilias
        a TLD registry operator
        one step up the food chain from a registrar
        uses pg to store ALL their DOMAINS

puppet
    open-source version - probably has all you want
    commercial version  - includes support contract, GUI

Declarative stuff
class postgreql {
    package {
        'postgresql-server':
        ensure => installed, provider => 'yum'
    }
    file {
        '/tmp/hellow-world.txt':
        content => 'Hello',
        owner => 'postgres',
        mode => 0644
    }
}

Templates
postgresql.conf.erb
----
shared_buffers = <%= shared_buffers %>
$conf_tempalte = '/my/template.erb' # eval'ed in the context of the template

/my/template.erb
----
file { "${pg_datadir}/postgresql.conf"
    owner => "$pguser",
    group => postgres,
    mode => 0644,
    require => Exec["${name}initdb]
}

Some params come from properties of the server itself
    e.g., IP address
    "facter" is a puppet component that collects facts about your
    system and exposes them as "facts" (= variables you can query)

    you can also write custom facts

Hiera
    puppet lib for looking up data using hierarchical queries
    against YAML files
    which are exports of your puppet data

    $port = Hiera('postgres_port')

    :hierarchy:
    -domains/%{domain}/%{fqdn}/%{application}

    postgresql.yaml
    ----
    postgres_port: 5432
    postgres_db_list:   /* maps dbname to owner */
        pgcon: ssinger
        pgeu:  jwieck

    Puppet provides a cron resource type:
    cron { "backup_${name}" #
        command => blah,
        user => 'postgtres',
        hour   => '0',
        minute => '0',
        ensure => 'present'
    }

And now for something completely different:
Slonik
(Slony's language)

cluster name = my_cluster
node 9181 admin conninifo = 'host=db1.on1 user=slony'

Soâ€¦
They use a puppet template to generate Slonik files

Hard things about puppet
    removing classes for services that you're no longer using
        without removing the service definitions
        well, then puppet complains

    managing passwords: where to put them?
        first try: he wrote custom functions to look up on the puppet master
        second: used a special Hiera backend that works on GPG-crypted YAML
