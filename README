These are my notes from the conference sessions at PGCon 2013.
I attended the two session days only (Thursday and Friday),
not the tutorials that preceded them. I didn't take notes at the unconference.

Since these are just my personal notes, they may be somewhat elliptical
and/or cryptic to others. Maybe they're useful, though. In any event, it's
useful to me to have them on GitHub.
